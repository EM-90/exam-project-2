# Holidaze

This project is part of my exam where I have attempted to learn and apply TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. Holidaze is a travel booking site where users can book venues for their stay.

## Features

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool for modern web projects.
- **React Router**: For handling client-side routing.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests.
